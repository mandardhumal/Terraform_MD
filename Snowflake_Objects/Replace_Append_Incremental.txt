Replace

used when data is dynamic and there is no consistent way to check it
used when data is too small to use incremental


Incremental Load

If the data is huge but the actual change is only less (delta record)
The issue is that if there is any change in historical data then it will be an issue. So advisable when there is no change in the historical data under any circumstances
Need to check the last entry key id to increment


Append

When the trend is to be plotted then Append should be used as most of the size of the data is less
When the columns are the same for more than 1 dataset and need to be merged
